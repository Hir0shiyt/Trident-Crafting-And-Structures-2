Trident Crafting & Strcutures 2 is a minecraft mod that adds randomly generated structures on the seas and also adds a crafting for the Trident since it's way too difficult
to get normally, but the mod won't make it easy for you to make the trident, you'll need certain sea related materials in order to craft it.

Thank you for trying out this mod, we are looking forwards to updating more this mod.
